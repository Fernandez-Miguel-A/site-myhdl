======  To the memory of George  ======

George Pantazopoulos has died on April 23, 2007, at the age of 29.

I have never met George, or spoken to him. So it goes with open source
projects. You work together with people that you only know indirectly
from their internet presence.  The cooperation is informal, so you
don't really worry when you don't hear from them for a while.
Yet George's death, now that I found out about it, feels like a
personal loss.

George must have the been the first one to do a complete project with
MyHDL, from spec to hardware implementation and system test. To me
this has been very important. It validated the concepts behind
MyHDL. It showed that the tool and its documentation were
mature enough for independent usage.

To complete such a project successfully, one needs exceptional
skills. Of course George was technically very strong. But
more importantly: he was open-minded and innovative, and
had a can-do attitude. Above all he was passionate about
his projects.

George was the kind of person that one would like to have
in the team for any kind of venture.

I am keeping George's pages here like they were when he last
edited them.

I learned a lot from George - and I am still doing.

Time is an illusion.

George, I am glad that you are with me.
