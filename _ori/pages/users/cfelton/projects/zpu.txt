====== MyHDL implementation of the ZPU processor ======

**Use at your own risk this is a project that has been started and currently in development.**

This project is a MyHDL and Python implementation of the [[http://opensource.zylin.com/zpu.htm|ZPU]] processor.  The ZPU processor 
is a small (very small) stack processor with a Gnu toolchain.  It is ideal for embedded
processor in FPGAs if one is needed.  

This project was started basically for fun but seemed like a good opportunity to unite
the ISS simulator and HDL in a single language.  The ZPU existing implementation the ISS simulator
is written in java and the HDL in verilog.  This project unites them to the Python language.
