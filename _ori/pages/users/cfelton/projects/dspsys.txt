====== DSPSYS Simple DSP Testbenches ======

This project shows how dspsys can be used to test/verify/analyze DSP 
digital circuits.  The dspsys creates Signal Processing models simply.
These models can be used to stimulate the circuit under test.  It allows 
for easy stimulus creation (common signal processing inputs, sine, random, etc) 
and analysis (plots, frequency plots, error variance).  Also allows for algorithm 
comparison.  "Golden Models" (floating point model) can be run against the HDL 
model in the same simulation.

@TODO add examples
