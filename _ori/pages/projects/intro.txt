====== Users & Projects ======


This page lists a number of MyHDL users and projects. The best thing you can do to support MyHDL is to add your project here and let people know about it! To make it easy to navigate to your projects, you can add the links to the [[projects:sidebar|sidebar]] page.

===== Jan Coombs =====

I am working on processor cores suitable for SoC use.  Two have been translated from Verilog into MyHDL, these are:

[[http://www.excamera.com/sphinx/fpga-j1.html|James Bowman's j1]]  a Novix style stack engine which supports multiple instructions in each 16b code word. 

[[http://http://bernd-paysan.de/b16.html|Bernd Paysan's b16]]  which is derived from the work of Chuck Moore, and has been used in real silicon.  

These processors are ideal for hardware exploration and debug using simple interactive tools. Potentially, the incremental software compiler and test environment can target the hardware, or the MyHDL model. 

Actel/Microsemi Igloo Nano dev kit: MyHDL source available to access and play with LEDs, switches, and UART link on this low power board.
