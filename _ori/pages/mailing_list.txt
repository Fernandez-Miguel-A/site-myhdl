====== Mailing List and Newsgroup ======

[[http://sourceforge.net/mail?group_id=91207|The MyHDL Mailing List]]
is used to exchange information about MyHDL. However, there are
more convenient interfaces than email to the same information, so
read on.

The mailing list is archived on [[http://gmane.org]], which
provides a bidirectional gateway to the mailing list. Gmane
lets you choose among a variety of interfaces to
access and search the mailing list information. Moreover,
there is no need to subscribe.

All interface options are described here:

In particular, to access the list as a usenet newsgroup, you
