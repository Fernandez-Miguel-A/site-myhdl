====== Logo ======

Thanks to Rodrigo Peixoto, MyHDL now has a logo. It looks a bit like a dune close to a brazilian beach :-)

Feel free to use the logo to indicate MyHDL usage and projects or for any other MyHDL-related occasion as you see fit.

Here are a number of versions with various pixel widths:
