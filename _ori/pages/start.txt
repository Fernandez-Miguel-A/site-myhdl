**MyHDL - From Python to Silicon!**

Welcome to the MyHDL website. MyHDL is an open source Python package that lets you go from Python to silicon.  With MyHDL, you can use Python as a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language|hardware description]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_verification_language|verification language]]. Furthermore, you can convert MyHDL code, that was developed towards implementation, to Verilog and VHDL automatically, and take it to a silicon implementation from there. 

On this website, you will find everything you need to get started - and to keep going - with MyHDL. Have fun!
