title:  How to add user info 
layout: simple_page 
---

To add user info, please first read the [/site-development].

MyHDL users can add their info under the `/users` directory.  If a single page
is sufficient, put the info in a `<username>.md` file. Otherwise, create a
directory `<username>` and add an `index.md` and other pages there.  There are
some placeholder files and directories to show how it works. You can start by
picking a placeholder and rename it. Use a `simple_page` layout if you don't
need a sidebar. 

Be sure to add the page or folder name in the `content` field of the
`users/index`.
