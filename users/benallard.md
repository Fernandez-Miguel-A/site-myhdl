PureDarwin is a pure hardware implementation of CoreWare : <https://bitbucket.org/benallard/puredarwin>

At the moment, it is not convertible, as lots of tests, as well as some *tracebenchs* in order to simulate it and observe the output in a vcd file (gtkwave). It is considered as being simulation capable.

Documentation is available on readthedocs: <http://puredarwin.readthedocs.org/>

[Status](http://puredarwin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/status.html) of the project is documented, the [ToDo](http://puredarwin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/todo.html) is a good place to start also.
