How to add user info {: .text-info}
====================

MyHDL users can add their info here.  If a single page is sufficient, put the
info in a `<username>.md` file. Otherwise, create a directory `<username>` and
add an `index.md` and other pages there.  There are some placeholder files and
directories to show how it works. You can start by picking a placeholder and
rename it. Use a `simple_page` layout if you don't need a sidebar.
