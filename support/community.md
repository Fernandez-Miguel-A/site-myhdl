[The MyHDL Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/p/myhdl/mailman) is used to
exchange information about MyHDL. However, there are more convenient interfaces
than email to the same information, so read on.

The mailing list is archived on <http://gmane.org>, which
provides a bidirectional gateway to the mailing list. Gmane
lets you choose among a variety of interfaces to
access and search the mailing list information. Moreover,
there is no need to subscribe.

All interface options are described here:
<http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl>.

In particular, to access the list as a usenet newsgroup, you
can use this link:
[The MyHDL Newsgroup](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.myhdl).
